## TDD and BDD Test Repository
This repository contains two folders, one for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and another for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tests.

## Introduction
In software development, testing is a crucial aspect of ensuring the quality and correctness of the code. TDD and BDD are two popular methodologies for designing and implementing tests in a structured and systematic manner.

* Test-Driven Development (TDD): TDD follows a cycle of "red, green, refactor." Developers start by writing tests that define the desired behavior of the code (red). Then, they write the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the tests (green). Finally, they refactor the code to improve its design and maintainability, while ensuring all tests continue to pass.

* Behavior-Driven Development (BDD): BDD focuses on defining and testing the behavior of the software from the user's perspective. It emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to create a common understanding of the desired behavior. BDD tests are written in a human-readable format using a domain-specific language (DSL) like Gherkin.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

TDD: This folder contains test suites and test cases written using the TDD approach. Each test suite focuses on a specific component or functionality of the codebase. The tests are written in a unit testing framework, such as JUnit, NUnit, or PyTest, depending on the programming language used.

BDD: This folder contains feature files and step definitions written using the BDD approach. The feature files define high-level scenarios and expected behaviors in a human-readable format using Gherkin syntax. The step definitions map these scenarios to code implementations that interact with the system under test. The BDD framework used can be Cucumber, SpecFlow, or Behat, depending on the programming language.
